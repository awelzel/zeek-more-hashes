Zeek::MoreHashes
================

Provide less common file hashes in a plugin. For now this includes MurmurHash3.

MurmurHash3
-----------

To add a mmh3 field to your files.log: Install this plugin and add the
following to your ``local.zeek``:

    @load zeek-more-hashes/mmh3

This plugin also provides built-in functions to compute MurmurHash3 in Zeek's
script-land: `mmh3_hash()`, `mmh3_hash_init()` `mmh3_hash_update()` and `mmh3_hash_finish()`.
